# IVA-Calculator
A small windows console app for calculating IVA, the most common tax in Paraguay.

Intended to help with calculating how much PYG you're actually spending if you're shopping online, as you gotta account for IVA exponentially.
If you have a prepaid card like me, you gotta calculate this everytime your purchase increases, so it's annoying AF.

Currently it only calculates IVA for online purchases in USD and converts them to PYG, as it was the use case I needed.
I may however, keep developing it.
